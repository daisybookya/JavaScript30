    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    let copy = players;

    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:


    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //copy.push('sky')
    copy[3] = 'sky';
    console.log(copy,players)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let copy2 = players.slice(); // = players.slice(0)
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let copy3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(`copy3:${copy3}`)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let copy4 = [...players];
    console.log(`copy4-es6 way: ${copy4}`)

    let copy5 = Array.from(players);
    copy4.push('dogs')
    console.log(`copy5-es6 way: ${copy5}`)

    let ex = Array.from([1, 2, 3], x => x + x);
    let ex2 = Array.from(ex);
    ex2[2]=100;
    console.log(`ex:${ex}`)
    console.log(`ex2:${ex2}`)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      color:{dark:{code:40}}
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    let newPerson = {...person};
    newPerson['gender']='male'; //有效，只改動newPerson
    newPerson.color.dark.code = 60; //無效
    console.log(newPerson,person)

    let try1 = Object.assign({},person,{'like':'eating'})
    try1.color.dark = 'blue'; //有效，改動所有
    try1.age=75; //有效，只改動try1
    console.log(try1,person)

    person.color.dark = 'pink'; //有效，改動所有
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    let try2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    try2.color.dark = 'brown'; //有效，只改動try2
    console.log(try2)
